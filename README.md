# GitYerShit
Simple tool to automate git pull and clone as well as build process for specific resources.

# Important
If you plan on building via Visual Studio make sure that you set "C++ Language Standard" to minimum **ISO C++20 Standard (/std:c++17)** (under Configuration Properties->C/C++).

## TODO
- [ ] Flush out process of automating building resources beyond "ox" resources that use "web" folder.
- [ ] Improve way of checking github repos and local directories.

#### I AM NOT PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR THIS TOOL AT THIS TIME.
